## What are linked lists?

Linked list is a sequence of nodes that are linked one by one in order by reference of neighboring node(s). Specifically, the more accurate definitions of various linked lists are given as the following.

- Singly linked lists

    Singly linked list is a data structure that contains a sequence of nodes such that each node contains an object and a reference to the next node in the list.
    The first node is referred to as the **head** and the last node is referred to as the **tail**; the tail's next field is null. Sometimes, a sentinel node or a self-loop can be used instead of null to mark the end of the list.

- Doubly linked lists

    In a Doubly linked list, each node has a link to its predecessor.
    
- Circularly linked lists

    Comparing with singly linked lists, tail of a circularly linked list uses its next reference to point back to the head of the list.
