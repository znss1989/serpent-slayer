Intro...

## What is a binary tree?

- Search path
- Leaf 9.13
- Depth & height

### Types

- Full binary tree
- Compelete ...
- Perfect ...
- Balanced ...

### Traverse

- Inorder
- Preorder, postorder

## How does it work

### Implementation

#### Linked structure

#### Array-based structure

#### With parent field

9.4

### Recursion

9.1, 9.2

### Manipulation and common techniques

#### Algorithms for balanced trees

#### Traverse

- Preorder and postorder
  9.11, 9.12
- Inorder 
  9.10
- BFS
- Euler tour

## Applications of binary trees

### Expression trees

## Discuss

General trees vs binary trees vs graphs
